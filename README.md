## Description
The main aim of this project was to provide statistical analisys of marketing campaigns on Facebook and visualize the results.
I used grouping by certain parameters (columns) matching with certain metrics. All visualisations were maid with the help of metplotlib and seaborn libraries.
In this analisys I tried out boxplot, histogram, heat map and linear plot (lmplot()).
